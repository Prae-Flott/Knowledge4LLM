iRobot® Create® 3 Hardware Overview
The Create® 3 is based on the Roomba®, a robot vacuum cleaner. Its sensors, actuators, and compact design are capable of navigating and mapping a the whole floor of a home or office space. The robot also ships with an iRobot® Home Base™ Charging Station.

The front of the robot features a multizone bumper with seven pairs of IR proximity sensors, which can be used to detect obstacles. The top of the robot contains three buttons which can all be overloaded by a ROS 2 application (only the • and •• buttons can be overloaded using the iRobot Education Bluetooth®1 protocol.) The power button features a ring of six RGB LEDs for indication.

Create® 3 from its above-rear-left, with the top cover and cargo bay removed.
The faceplate and cargo bay of the robot feature a regular hole pattern for attaching payloads and can be removed without tools for quick prototyping. There are two cable passthroughs: one on the top edge of the cargo bay which is good for quick prototyping and one that penetrates the top cover and faceplate which is useful for keeping wires within the radius of the robot. More information on these features can be found on the Mechanical page.

Also visible with the faceplate removed is the adapter board, which is used to interface to external computers either through Bluetooth®1 or via USB-C®2. More information on this board is available on the Electrical page.

The bottom of the robot includes four cliff sensors to keep the robot on solid ground, a front caster (by default, the robot's center of gravity is forward of the center axis), charging contacts, two wheels with current sensors and encoders, and an optical odometry sensor. Not visible is the robot's IMU, which is used with the optical odometry sensor and wheel encoders to generate a fused odometry estimate.

iRobot® Create® 3 Mechanical System
The Create® 3 is a differential drive robot designed for traversing relatively-flat, indoor environments. The drive wheels feature independent suspensions to help the robot overcome typical carpet or door thresholds.

Payload
Payload attachment surfaces Sensors or accessories can be attached to the faceplate or internal cargo bay, both of which feature a regular 12 mm grid of 3 mm diameter mounting holes. The maximum recommended payload weight (without changing acceleration limits) is 9 kg directly above the center of gravity of the chassis. The robot can handle more weight with reduced acceleration limits or careful management of the load.

Notice

To prevent damage to the robot or payload, ensure the faceplate and/or payload are well secured to the chassis before use.

Removing or attaching the faceplate
The faceplate is removed by rotating it on the center axis of the robot using the thumb rests. Four locating pins on the top cover are used to install and retain the faceplate. How to Remove or Attach Create® 3 Faceplate

Notice

Always remove the Create® 3 robot’s faceplate prior to dismantling, adjusting, altering, or affecting the faceplate at the risk of damaging the robot.

Locking the faceplate
If you would like to lock the faceplate and prevent it from rotating, you may insert an M3 self-tapping screw or pin in the faceplate hole marked with the image of a screw (while the faceplate is attached). How to Lock Create® 3 Faceplate

Attachment Tips and Tricks
Self-tapping screws with bosses
The Create® 3 robot's holes are sized for M3 or #4 screws. It is possible to use special self-tapping plastic screws (or in a pinch, sheet metal or wood screws) to screw through the cover into a 3D-printed boss. Many of our example STLs use this technique.

Machine screws with nuts
The Create® 3 robot's holes are sized for M3 or #4 screws.

Cable ties
Cable ties (also known as zip ties) can be threaded through the 3 mm holes. 2.5 mm widths are common and fit nicely.

Twist ties
Twist ties are a quick, cheap, and reusable way for holding wires or other non-structural pieces.

Plastic Rivets
Push-in, split-shank plastic rivets (either for M3 or 0.115" holes) are fast and inexpensive ways to mount thin stock to the Create® 3 robot's faceplate.

Highly sophisticated interlocking brick system
The typical toy brick has its studs spaced at 8 mm, while Create® 3's holes are spaced at 12 mm. It is possible to place an stud adapter mount into every other hole in order to connect toy bricks to the Create® 3. We recommend printing at 100% infill.

Adding sensors
A growing library of printable mounts for attaching sensors to the Create 3 robot using its 12 mm grid of 3 mm holes is available here.

Adding a rear caster
Out of the box, Create® 3 has a center of gravity in front of the two drive wheels and features an integrated front caster to act as a third point of contact. If you add a payload that is heavy and/or causes the robot center of gravity to move behind the drive wheels, you may want to add a second caster wheel in the rear to prevent sliding along the back edge. Below you will find designs for two, 3D-printable solutions which add a second Roomba® caster wheel to the rear of the Create® 3.

Rear caster attachment
The first option is a smaller print (99 x 83 x 58 mm) that attaches to the rear of the Create® 3 cargo bay. It is faster and simpler to build but protrudes 54 mm behind the rear of the robot, so it may not be suitable for situations were the robot needs to navigate tight spaces or in cluttered environments.

Rear caster attachment

The rear caster attachment is held in place between the handle and cable passthrough of the cargo bay using a printed latch and two M3 or #4 self-tapping screws. The Roomba® caster wheel is inserted into the bottom opening and held in place with a small locking piece which is then screwed into place. If the caster does not rotate freely, sand or file the bearing surface along the caster's axis of rotation.

Cargo bay with integrated caster
The second option replaces the included Cargo Bay with one that contains an integrated rear caster. It requires a larger print volume (208 x 201 x 66 mm) and slightly reduces the cargo space, but the solution does not protrude beyond the back of the robot. This allows the robot to turn in tight spaces and reduces the likelihood of the caster attachment getting caught on objects in the environment.

Cargo bay with caster

To assemble, insert the Roomba® caster wheel through the bottom and hold it in place with the printed caster lock which is secured with an M3 self-tapping screw. Depending on your payload weight and distribution, you may also want to transfer the ballast from the included Create® 3 cargo bay to this new one.
