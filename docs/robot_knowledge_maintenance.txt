Maintenance of robotâ€™s base is required when an object is stuck under the robot's base, and data from the ROS2 topic /cliff_intensity from the cliff sensors exceeds specific thresholds: cliff_side_right exceeds 2215; cliff_front_right exceeds 2250; cliff_front_left exceeds 2219; cliff_side_left exceeds 2240. The robot has four cliff sensors (front-left, front-right, left side, and right side), and their readings normally fluctuate periodically around an average, with a min-max range within 25. Obstructions like plates or cables under the robot can cause abnormal cliff sensor values.

Maintenance of robot's wheel is required when dirt, hair, or small particles might stick to the wheel or axle, hindering the rotation of the wheels. This is indicated when the Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) values pwm_left or pwm_right in the ROS2 topic /wheel_status exceed 14,000. The reason for the high PWM values is that higher torque is now required to rotate the wheels of the robot. The PWM signal on each wheel controls motor torque and typically varies periodically.

Maintenance of robot's charging is required when the battery loading percentage is lower than 20 percent to protect the battery. This is identified when the percentage in the ROS2 topic /battery_status is lower than 20.00. Battery capacity should remain above 20 percent to maintain battery health and ensure the robot can return to the docking station. Battery voltage gradually decreases during robot operation.
