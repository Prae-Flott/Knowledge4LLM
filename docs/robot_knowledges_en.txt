The failure mode camera contamination is primarily caused by factors such as the absence or ineffective sealing of the camera housing, dust, oil, and other aggressive substances, as well as dust being stirred up by the robot and settling on surfaces. This contamination can lead to various component-level effects, including degraded camera function, poor light intake, blurred images, lens surface wear or damage, and the need for cleaning, which could risk further damage due to scratches during cleaning. At the system level, this failure impacts the robot's computer vision capabilities, causing incorrect classification, poor navigation, and loss of spatial orientation, ultimately rendering object recognition nonfunctional. For the overall multi-robot system, the consequences are even more severe, affecting path planning, increasing the risk of collisions, reducing the system’s overall performance, and elevating the failure rate across the fleet, leading to more frequent collisions.

The failure mode IR sensor contamination is caused by poor sealing of the sensor housing, dust, oil, and other aggressive substances, as well as dust stirred up by the robot and accumulated dirt on sensors close to the ground. This contamination can result in poor sensor performance, the need for cleaning (which may cause damage during the process), interference from dust during detection, and scratched sensor surfaces due to dust. At the system level, it affects the robot's distance measurements, obstacle avoidance, and overall perception, leading to incorrect assessments of the environment. For the overall multi-robot system, this failure results in reduced performance, increased failure rates across the fleet, and a higher frequency of collisions.

The failure mode wheel blockage is caused by several factors, including excessive play between the wheel and housing, gearbox or motor wear or damage, wheel dirt or wear, mechanical component breakage, dirt accumulation from the floor, small objects like screws or nails entering the wheel, debris or lint colliding with obstacles, and cables or fibers wrapping around the wheel. This can lead to component-level effects such as mechanical damage, excessive current that overloads the electronics, high torque stress on the motor and gearbox, increasing wear on these components, and potential damage to the wheel or axle if the issue persists. At the robot system level, the failure can make movement difficult or impossible, cause the robot to veer off course, lead to unpredictable total failure, and result in both electrical and, in the worst case, mechanical damage. This failure severely impacts the multi-robot system, causing reduced performance, blocking important paths or routes, necessitating external intervention, and preventing tasks from being completed.

The failure mode robot blockage can occur due to factors such as insufficient or incorrect sensing, unforeseen object placement or uneven terrain, the robot maneuvering in circles, driving over small objects, navigation errors (e.g., two robots attempting to reach the same spot), and chassis or housing component failures. This leads to component-level effects like mechanical damage, potential housing damage, motor overloading or stalling, detachment of critical parts, or, in some cases, no damage but an inability to achieve its goal independently. At the robot system level, the failure makes movement difficult or impossible, prevents the robot from completing its task, and reduces its lifespan due to collisions and wear. On the multi-robot system level, the failure prevents the completion of its goal, and if multiple robots are blocked, the entire task cannot be completed.


The failure mode charging failure is caused by several factors, including incorrect positioning or alignment during docking due to sensor errors, a defective charging station contact, a malfunctioning robot contact, robot failure, corrosion of contacts, and aging of the battery or electronics. This failure can lead to component-level issues such as potential battery damage, deep discharge if not addressed, and eventual battery failure. At the robot system level, the failure results in abnormal behaviors such as erratic movement, unexpected restarts, camera failure, collisions, and eventual robot shutdown. In the multi-robot system, charging failure can increase task completion time or make the goal unachievable, cause the charging station to be inoperable, and block other robots from charging if they are obstructed by the failed robot. As more robots are blocked, the overall task cannot be completed.
